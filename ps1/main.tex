\section{Personal Statement}
\paragraph{}
In Computational Physics, my goal is to further develop my Python programming skills, particularly in the context of data analysis for laboratory experiments. With a foundation in physics and mathematics, I'm already comfortable with Python. After completing my degree, I'm considering graduate studies in physics with a theoretical emphasis, where I plan to leverage my programming skills in Python for data analysis in research 
projects. Github username is dkt9447
